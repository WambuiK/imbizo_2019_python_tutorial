# Welcome to the IBRO-Simons Computational Neuroscience Imbizo 2019!

The imbizo will involve a lot of Python coding, so please go through this tutorial before the course begins so we can hit the ground running when we get here. It shouldn't take more than an hour or two.


# What you need

To run this tutorial you will need a Python 3 installation, along with the following scientific packages: numpy, scipy, pandas, matplotlib, and jupyter.


# Installing Python and Jupyter

The easiest way to get going is to follow the [Jupyter Notebook Quickstart Guide](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html). This will have you install Anaconda (a scientific Python distribution with all the packages we'll use) and show you how to run your first Jupyter notebook.

If you have a slow connection or are short on hard drive space, you can alternatively install [MiniConda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) for Python 3.7, and install the required packages individually using `conda`, as described in the link.


# Running this tutorial

Click the green "Clone or Download" link in the upper right and save this tutorial to your computer. 

Next, set the Jupyter startup folder to be the folder you downloaded the tutorial into, as per section 3.1.1/3.1.2 in the [Jupyter Notebook Quickstart Guide](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html). (Alternatively, if launching Jupyter from the command line, just make sure to `cd` into the tutorial directory before running `jupyter notebook`.)

Open the Jupyter notebook `0_start_here`, put your cursor in the first cell and hit CTRL + ENTER. If it prints out a welcome message you've done everything right and are good to go.

Close and shutdown the `0_start_here` notebook and open up `1_sciencing_with_python` to begin!

(Note: this tutorial covers the basics to get you started with Python and Jupyter and while it describes some features making Python a useful programming language for science, there are many more that have not been covered.)

Recommendation for how to do this tutorial. Read the whole thing to get an understanding of everything it covers. Don't worry about memorizing the syntax.

Next, open up the exercises notebook and work through them with the tutorial open as a reference. If you do the exercises yourself before looking at the solutions, you will get much more out of the tutorial. However, the solutions are there if you get stuck, or to check your results once you've finished.


# If you have any difficulties with your installation

Search around for your problem on Google/Stackoverflow, as many others will probably have encountered and solved the same situation. If you can't find the answers you need, you can email one of the TAs.
