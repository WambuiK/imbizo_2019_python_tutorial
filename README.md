# Getting started

Welcome to the IBRO-Simons Computational Neuroscience Imbizo 2019!

The imbizo will involve a lot of Python coding, so please go through this tutorial before the course begins so we can hit the ground running when we get here. It shouldn't take more than an hour or two.


## What you need

To run this tutorial you will need a Python 3 installation, along with the following scientific packages: numpy, scipy, pandas, matplotlib, and jupyter.


## Installation

The easiest way to get going is to follow the [Jupyter Notebook Quickstart Guide](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html). This will have you install Anaconda (a scientific Python distribution including all the packages we'll be using) and show you how to open up and run your first Jupyter notebook.

If you have a slow internet connection or are short on hard drive space, you can alternatively install [MiniConda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) for Python 3.7, and install the required packages individually using `conda`, as described in the link.


## Running this tutorial

Click the green "Clone or Download" link in the upper right and save this tutorial to your computer. 

Next, set the Jupyter startup folder to be the folder you downloaded the tutorial into, as per section 3.1.1/3.1.2 in the [Jupyter Notebook Quickstart Guide](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html). (Alternatively, if launching Jupyter from the command line, just make sure to `cd` into the tutorial directory before running `jupyter notebook`.)

Open the Jupyter notebook 0_start_here, put your cursor in the first cell and hit CTRL + ENTER. If it prints out a welcome message you've done everything right and are good to go.

Close and shutdown the 0_start_here notebook and open up 1_sciencing_with_python to begin!


## If you have any difficulties with your installation

Don't hesitate to reach out via email to any of the TAs.
