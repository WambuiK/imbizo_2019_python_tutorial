# Welcome to the IBRO-Simons Computational Neuroscience Imbizo 2019!

The imbizo will involve a lot of Python coding, so please go through this tutorial before the course begins so we can hit the ground running when we get here. It shouldn't take more than an hour or two.

This tuotrial assumes some familiarity with coding, but not necessarily with the Python programming language. If you are brand new to coding in Python, follow the installation steps listed here, and then check out Sections 3-5 of the [official Python tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/) before getting going on this one.

# What you need

To run this tutorial you will need a Python 3 installation, along with the following scientific packages: numpy, scipy, pandas, matplotlib, and jupyter.


# Installing Python and Jupyter

The easiest way to get going is to follow the [Jupyter Notebook Quickstart Guide](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html). This will have you install Anaconda (a scientific Python distribution with all the packages we'll use) and show you how to run your first Jupyter notebook.

If you have a slow connection or are short on hard drive space, you can alternatively install [MiniConda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) for Python 3.7, and install the required packages individually using `conda`, as described in the link.

## If you have any difficulties with your installation

Search around for your problem on Google/Stackoverflow, as many others will probably have encountered and solved the same situation. If you can't find the answers you need, you can email one of the TAs. Installing Anaconda and Jupyter, however, should be fairly straightforward.

# What's in the tutorial

The tutorial is broken into three main instructional notebooks.

The first, [1_basic_python](1_basic_python.ipynb) goes over the basics of using Python as a programming language. The second, [2_scientific_python](2_scientific_python.ipynb) introduces many common scientific operations and how to do them in Python. The third, [3_tips_tricks_gotchas](3_tips_tricks_gotchas.ipynb) goes over several important gotchas (things to be aware of that may catch you off guard) and some helpful tips and tricks to speed up your Python and make it more fun.

Note that true Pythonistas may notice that not everything in this notebook is done in the most "Pythonic" way, but rather to emphasize clarity and conceptual simplicty. But there are often many other and better ways of doing what's shown in these notebooks.

# Running this tutorial

Click the green "Clone or Download" link in the upper right and save this tutorial to your computer. 

Next, set the Jupyter startup folder to be the folder you downloaded the tutorial into, as per section 3.1.1/3.1.2 in the [Jupyter Notebook Quickstart Guide](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html). (Alternatively, if launching Jupyter from the command line, just make sure to `cd` into the tutorial directory before running `jupyter notebook`.)

Open the Jupyter notebook `0_start_here`, put your cursor in the first cell and hit CTRL + ENTER. If it prints out a welcome message you've done everything right and are good to go.

Close and shutdown the `0_start_here` notebook and open up `1_sciencing_with_python` to begin!

(Note: this tutorial covers the basics to get you started with Python and Jupyter and while it describes some features making Python a useful programming language for science, there are many more that have not been covered.)

# How to get the most from this tutorial

1. Read over the whole tutorial in detail (notebooks 0-3), running the code cells as you encounter them and ensuring you understand exactly what is going on in each. Don't worry about memorizing syntax. The idea here is to show you what Python can do in a scientific context and to give you a reference you can come back to.
2. With the tutorial open as a reference, work through the exercises. Don't look at the solutions until you finish the exercise or if you really get stuck.
3. If you feel confident in your ability to do the exercises, you're ready for the big time.
